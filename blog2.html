            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The field of quantum physics, often referred to as quantum mechanics, is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic scale. It is a realm of science that challenges our classical intuitions and has led to incredible discoveries about the nature of reality. In this article, we'll delve into the fascinating world of quantum physics and explore some of its mysteries.</p>

            <h2>Wave-Particle Duality</h2>
            <p>One of the fundamental concepts in quantum physics is the wave-particle duality. It suggests that particles, such as electrons and photons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on the circumstances. This duality is exemplified by the famous double-slit experiment, which demonstrates the probabilistic nature of quantum entities.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement</h2>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle is instantly influenced by the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. Einstein famously referred to this as "spooky action at a distance." Despite its counterintuitive nature, entanglement has been experimentally confirmed and is a cornerstone of quantum information science.</p>

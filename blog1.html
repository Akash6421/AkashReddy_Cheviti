            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My theory of relativity, one of the most groundbreaking scientific theories of the 20th century, has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe. But did you know that its principles also apply to our everyday lives? In this article, we'll explore some practical applications of relativity in our daily experiences.</p>

            <h2>Time Dilation</h2>
            <p>One of the key concepts of relativity is time dilation, which means that time can pass at different rates for different observers. In our fast-paced world, this phenomenon is evident in GPS satellites. These satellites are equipped with atomic clocks that run slightly faster than clocks on Earth's surface due to their orbital velocity. To maintain accurate GPS positioning, this relativistic effect must be considered.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational Lensing</h2>
            <p>Another fascinating aspect of relativity is gravitational lensing. This phenomenon occurs when massive objects, such as stars or galaxies, bend the path of light as it travels through space. It can create multiple images of the same object, like cosmic mirages. While we may not observe this effect directly, astronomers use it to study distant galaxies and dark matter.</p>
